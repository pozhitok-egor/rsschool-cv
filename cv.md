## Summary 
When I was 13 years old I made my first site. It was made with the help of free site builder. But since that time I started studying programming. 
By this day I have already made a lot of interesting things. For example, Discord and telegram bots, online store written in javascript, web-service, where users buy scripts for game, small games etc.
Now I want to improve my skills in programming, especially in web-programming and improve my English level. Also I'd like to meet new interesting people, make new friends and get a good job.
